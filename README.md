# Project Summary
## End the Syndemic: Syringes, The sharpest enemy

Syringe sharing continues to increase the spread of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and other fatal diseases, creating a syndemic and skyrocketing healthcare costs. Every county in TN has been significantly affected by the syndemic, and by analyzing state-wide hospital discharge data, we will determine which counties would benefit most from new syringe exchange programs that assist patients with substance use disorders, slow the spread of disease, and reduce the overall healthcare cost. We will also create an interactive dashboard that will assist in the lobbying for new syringe-sharing programs in the Tennessee counties that need them the most.

## Written Report:

The HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance use disorders (SUDs), and viral hepatitis syndemic has uniquely ravaged the world for several years, but despite this, many communities still lack the proper planning or investment in key resources to fight it. Fortunately, the nation has begun to take a stand, with many communities joining together to make a plan for universal change. As of 2020,Amber Coyne was hired by the CDC to begin forming one of these plans for the state of Tennessee. Historically, my work with the CDC has allowed me to work in many roles, but I know that the Sewanee DataLab would be the best fit to handle some key data in my mission. As a whole, our main mission is to bring awareness to the Syndemic and the Syringe Sharing Programs in Tennessee, which we currently have two of. The effectiveness and versatility of these clinics have been proven time and time again, but not enough communities understand the aid they could be providing them. It would be ideal if the team could approach this project similarly to how the state of Michigan analyzed factors connected with the syndemic, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and skin, soft tissue, venous infections (SSTVIs). A strong understanding of these factors, along with information like the hospital's ICD-10 codes, would allow you to understand both how quickly the syndemic is worsening as well as how much hospitals could be saving if they had something like syringe-sharing programs in place to assist them. Ultimately, I would like a simple but extensive interactive dashboard accessible to both the community and professionals which synthesizes the data. The dashboard should include but not be limited to the costs spent by the state to treat these communities versus what they could have saved, what assistance each local area is already providing to those in need, what areas are most in need, and how the aforementioned factors relate to age, race, sex, length of hospital stay, payer, discharge disposition, and cost. Secondarily, any models predicting trends would be incredibly helpful and appreciated. This project has the potential to shape not only the lives of Tennesseeans but of the entire world, so I look forward to working with you over the next few weeks to make a difference.

# Goal Setting, Acceptance Criteria and Pre Mortem

Our [Presentation]( https://github.com/alankespinoza/DataLab_2022/blob/master/Deliverables/Goal-setting%20and%20acceptance%20criteria%20_%20Pre-Mortem.pdf )

## Goal-Setting Written Report

### Dashboard (Basic Goal/MVP)

* A basic goal of ours is a dashboard which includes but is not limited to graphs plottings the costs spent by the state to treat these communities versus what they could have saved, what assistance each local area is already providing to those in need, a map showing what areas are most in need, and graphs showing the aforementioned factors relating to age, race, sex, length of hospital stay, payer, discharge disposition, and cost.
* Our goal is for this to be interactive and able to be expanded upon in the case that new data is gained. Since we have not been able to meet with our partner, we are not sure who, if anyone, will be able to maintain, retrain, or generally update the dashboard as time goes on.
* The dashboard will be online in the form of a website. It will be public with the aforementioned graphical requirements; this is still being determined by our partner. Depending on the information we find once we gain access to the data is what will determine whether or not we want large written sections or not.

### Important Data Visuals  (Basic Goal/MVP)

* We hope to provide simple, valuable graphs and visualizations that could be used to create a one-pager similar to the Michigan Study in the case that we do not have the ability to make one ourselves. This includes graphs with cost of treating each health area versus expected cost for syringe exchange programs as well as graphs relating factors like race, age, etc to endemic factors.
* We know this is successful if Amber is able to pull different graphs under this deliverable to be able to create her own one-pager and use these visuals for any other part of her job.

### Predictive Models (Aspirational/Goal #2)

* It is an aspiration of ours to provide models that could predict trends for future use. The nature of these models is something we will discuss with both technical staff and our partner.
* We are not sure what level of accuracy is acceptable to our partner.

### One Pager (Aspirational/ Goal #3)

* Much of our work so far has been inspired by a similar project in Michigan, which produced a concise one page study. While we hope to provide a dashboard, it would be useful to our partner if we could also provide her something in the same format as their one-pager. She intends to use the one pager to make the data easy to read, easily accessible, digestible and compelling to lobby for policy change in the Tennessee General Assembly. 

### Develop a Relationship with our Client (Aspirational/ Goal #4)
* Since Datalab tends to have very good relationships with their partners, but our partner is so busy, we hope to develop some sort of relationship with her and her cause (as much as we can, because getting involved in politics is tricky).
 
## Pre-Mortem Written Report

### The data is incredibly large.

* When first working with the data, most of our computers struggled to download it. It took a prolonged period of time and in most cases made a noticeable difference in how fast our computers were able to function. Our worst case scenario here is that once we combine the data with R that our computers won’t be able to function at all.
* Our plan B for this scenario is that we find a computer, possibly ATC, or from a mentor that could handle the data.
* If not, we would have to make smaller queries for our computer to be able to handle. We can focus more on specific data and analyze smaller groups of data.
* Since the data is so large, we may not be able to dive into the data as in depth as we have with much smaller data sets. This could potentially lead us to misrepresenting the dataset and providing a deliverable to Ms. Coyne that is both inaccurate and potentially dangerous. 
* For this scenario, if we see that we are running out of time and have too much data to go through. We would pick specific factors we want to focus on, based on our partner and just focus on that. Quality over quantity!

### Our client is incredibly busy!

* Despite efforts to reach out to our client we have not been able to meet with them yet. We’ve been told that they will be busy for the rest of the month, and we’re still not sure if she’ll be free for us the next. In addition to this, we’ve been given a handful of different benchmarks for what success looks like. Our biggest concern here is that we will provide a deliverable that is not useful or not similar to what the client had in mind. 
* For this scenario, we would just have to keep bugging her until she nudges, and when we finally do meet her to have an extensive list of questions to make that time worth a while.
* We would also try to get Datalab directors to talk to her, she is a client and needs to be able to set some time to speak to us. 
* In the case that she never replies, we do know that Jim Peterman has been in contact with her, so we can try to reach her through him or just have him fill her role if she’s that busy.

### Uncertainty about the level of accuracy for the predictive model. 
* Although predicting trends is an aspirational goal of ours, as aforementioned, we do not want to make a product that is dangerously inaccurate and misleading. The consequences for misleading our partner and lawmakers could hinder the advocacy work for syringe exchange clinics, which defeats our purpose. 
* If we have a hard time creating an acceptable predictive model, we will consult with Datalab’s technical staff and allow them to help guide our next steps. 
* If we decide not to produce the predictive model, we will let it be a starting point for future Datalab interns or Amber Coyne’s tech staff to pick up and work on

# Literature Review 

The term “syndemic” comes from combining the terms “synergy” and “epidemic.” Though the concept of a syndemic may be new, the prevalence of the factors that create a syndemic are well known. The uptick of HIV, substance use disorders, sexually-transmitted infections, and viral hepatitis are documented and understood. Our partner, Amber Coyne is spearheading the initiative, End the Syndemic Tennessee, which is focused on lessening the prevalence of those conditions by advocating for the establishment of more syringe exchange programs in Tennessee. The website for the initiative, https://endthesyndemictn.org/learn-more/, that is devoted to making the public aware of the syndemic that is affecting their communities. The website contains national and state-specific facts around the factors that the End the Syndemic are trying to alleviate, along with interactive dashboards around mental health data and the factors contributing to the syndemic. 

Raising awareness and making information about the syndemic available will help spark community conversations about the syndemic, and hopefully garner support for more syringe exchange programs (SEPs). Despite numerous studies such as an analysis of Washington D.C’s SEPs, a longitudinal study conducted in New York,  and the Michigan Study, which is used as a reference for our project, there is not universal support for SEPs. With the intent to gain support for SEPs across the likes of many, like the Michigan Study, our team intends to frame the syndemic in a way that details the economic impact of the treatment costs, instead of solely focusing on the community health aspect of the syndemic. At the conclusion of the project, we will produce a dashboard that reflects the cost analysis of the treatments for HIV, STIs, viral hepatitis, and SUDs. 

The Michigan Study, formally the “Trends in Morbidity, Mortality, and Cost of
Hospitalizations Associated With Infectious Disease Sequelae of the Opioid Epidemic”, laid much of the groundwork for our work today; it was even the inspiration for our partner to reach out to us in the first place. Due to their work our partner and mentors knew what data we would need as well as what we need to focus on to be able advocate for the End the Syndemic program in Tennessee. Our methods have been almost solely inspired by theirs as well as our own goals for what we hope to accomplish in our analysis here.

New York’s longitudinal study, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted over a span of 12 years, found that as a result of SEP establishment, 

* HIV prevalence decreased from 50 percent to 17 percent

* Hepatitis C infections decreased from 80 percent to 59 percent among HIV-negative intravenous drug users

* And after a cost-effective analysis, SEPs would save the government $1,300 to $3,000 per client. 

Additionally, Washington D.C.’s SEP clinics 

* 70 percent decrease in new HIV cases among IDU

* 120 HIV cases averted in two years

As shown with the facts above, SEPs are cost efficient and they reduce the risk of disease transmission. 

It is also worth noting that the placement of clinics plays a large role in their accessibility to different target populations. According to Welton et al., in urban areas, clinics should be placed within a 10-minute walk from someone’s home. In rural settings, this may not always be possible, so the National Harm Reduction Coalition proposed that clinics in rural areas should have flexible hours to accommodate different schedules and methods of travel, and they should seek feedback from the target population and the community that the clinic will be placed in. Furthermore, to maximize the benefits the clinic provides to its clients, the clinic should work in conjunction with local law enforcement, faith groups, and other community resource centers. 

According to Syndemics and the Biosocial Conception of Health, the authors’ state that “Primary care providers should consider developing closer associations with community advocates and service workers to build healthy structural change (Bulled et al.). Establishing programs that aim to mitigate the impacts of a syndemic are described by the authors as “rarely take centre stage in public health because funding sources are described as “outcomes-oriented,”” having an “unfounded prioritisation of some diseases,” and most importantly, “efforts to build national health systems can face steep opposition,” which is a primary reason many of them are not in place. The “steep opposition” can be due in part to a lack of understanding about addiction, disease, transmission, and treatment options (Bulled et al.). 

Opposition to syringe exchange programs takes form in different ways. As mentioned in an earlier presentation, one of the grandest goals of our project is to help end the stigma around these programs and addiction. Occasionally, local stigmas about addiction and syringe sharing programs are more prevalent than modern evidence about their effectiveness. According to Subeksha Sharma, author of The Needle Exchange Program Crisis, many opponents of the program fear that by providing needle exchange kits that communities may be enabling drug abuse. Moreover, stigma around addicts has inspired fear in constituents that by putting these clinics in public spaces may actually increase crime; nothing we could find suggested this was true though. This in turn regularly dissuades politicians from supporting the programs despite their benefits due to the damage it could cause to their careers. Even for politicians willing to support the project, federal support has been consistently unreliable in the past. While legal and financial aid has been offered it is often quite limited, or, as in the case with recent presidents, has had no follow through despite official promises of expanded aid. Local stigmas alongside the bloated, complex bureaucracy strangles support that could otherwise bolster the healthcare cause that syringe exchange programs aim to aid (Sharma).

#  Data Description 
The data being used by Syndemic is gathered from patient records from TN hospitals in 2019. Hospitals send patient discharge data to the TN Department of Health, and the TN Department of Health sells the data.
