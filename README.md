## Project Summary
### End the Syndemic: Syringes, The sharpest enemy

Syringe sharing continues to increase the spread of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and other fatal diseases, creating a syndemic and skyrocketing healthcare costs. Every county in TN has been significantly affected by the syndemic, and by analyzing state-wide hospital discharge data, we will determine which counties would benefit most from new syringe exchange programs that assist patients with substance use disorders, slow the spread of disease, and reduce the overall healthcare cost. We will also create an interactive dashboard that will assist in the lobbying for new syringe-sharing programs in the Tennessee counties that need them the most.
