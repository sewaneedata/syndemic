# Project Summary
## End the Syndemic: Syringes, The sharpest enemy

Syringe sharing continues to increase the spread of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and other fatal diseases, creating a syndemic and skyrocketing healthcare costs. Every county in TN has been significantly affected by the syndemic, and by analyzing state-wide hospital discharge data, we will determine which counties would benefit most from new syringe exchange programs that assist patients with substance use disorders, slow the spread of disease, and reduce the overall healthcare cost. We will also create an interactive dashboard that will assist in the lobbying for new syringe-sharing programs in the Tennessee counties that need them the most.

## Written Report:

The HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance use disorders (SUDs), and viral hepatitis syndemic has uniquely ravaged the world for several years, but despite this, many communities still lack the proper planning or investment in key resources to fight it. Fortunately, the nation has begun to take a stand, with many communities joining together to make a plan for universal change. As of 2020,Amber Coyne was hired by the CDC to begin forming one of these plans for the state of Tennessee. Historically, my work with the CDC has allowed me to work in many roles, but I know that the Sewanee DataLab would be the best fit to handle some key data in my mission. As a whole, our main mission is to bring awareness to the Syndemic and the Syringe Sharing Programs in Tennessee, which we currently have two of. The effectiveness and versatility of these clinics have been proven time and time again, but not enough communities understand the aid they could be providing them. It would be ideal if the team could approach this project similarly to how the state of Michigan analyzed factors connected with the syndemic, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and skin, soft tissue, venous infections (SSTVIs). A strong understanding of these factors, along with information like the hospital's ICD-10 codes, would allow you to understand both how quickly the syndemic is worsening as well as how much hospitals could be saving if they had something like syringe-sharing programs in place to assist them. Ultimately, I would like a simple but extensive interactive dashboard accessible to both the community and professionals which synthesizes the data. The dashboard should include but not be limited to the costs spent by the state to treat these communities versus what they could have saved, what assistance each local area is already providing to those in need, what areas are most in need, and how the aforementioned factors relate to age, race, sex, length of hospital stay, payer, discharge disposition, and cost. Secondarily, any models predicting trends would be incredibly helpful and appreciated. This project has the potential to shape not only the lives of Tennesseeans but of the entire world, so I look forward to working with you over the next few weeks to make a difference.

# Goal Setting, Acceptance Criteria and Pre Mortem

## Goal-Setting Written Report

### Dashboard (Basic Goal/MVP)

* A basic goal of ours is a dashboard which includes but is not limited to graphs plottings the costs spent by the state to treat these communities versus what they could have saved, what assistance each local area is already providing to those in need, a map showing what areas are most in need, and graphs showing the aforementioned factors relating to age, race, sex, length of hospital stay, payer, discharge disposition, and cost.
* Our goal is for this to be interactive and able to be expanded upon in the case that new data is gained. Since we have not been able to meet with our partner, we are not sure who, if anyone, will be able to maintain, retrain, or generally update the dashboard as time goes on.
* The dashboard will be online in the form of a website. It will be public with the aforementioned graphical requirements; this is still being determined by our partner. Depending on the information we find once we gain access to the data is what will determine whether or not we want large written sections or not.

### Important Data Visuals  (Basic Goal/MVP)

* We hope to provide simple, valuable graphs and visualizations that could be used to create a one-pager similar to the Michigan Study in the case that we do not have the ability to make one ourselves. This includes graphs with cost of treating each health area versus expected cost for syringe exchange programs as well as graphs relating factors like race, age, etc to endemic factors.
* We know this is successful if Amber is able to pull different graphs under this deliverable to be able to create her own one-pager and use these visuals for any other part of her job.

### Predictive Models (Aspirational/Goal #2)

* It is an aspiration of ours to provide models that could predict trends for future use. The nature of these models is something we will discuss with both technical staff and our partner.
* We are not sure what level of accuracy is acceptable to our partner.

### One Pager (Aspirational/ Goal #3)

* Much of our work so far has been inspired by a similar project in Michigan, which produced a concise one page study. While we hope to provide a dashboard, it would be useful to our partner if we could also provide her something in the same format as their one-pager. She intends to use the one pager to make the data easy to read, easily accessible, digestible and compelling to lobby for policy change in the Tennessee General Assembly. 

### Develop a Relationship with our Client (Aspirational/ Goal #4)
* Since Datalab tends to have very good relationships with their partners, but our partner is so busy, we hope to develop some sort of relationship with her and her cause (as much as we can, because getting involved in politics is tricky).
 
## Pre-Mortem Written Report

### The data is incredibly large.

* When first working with the data, most of our computers struggled to download it. It took a prolonged period of time and in most cases made a noticeable difference in how fast our computers were able to function. Our worst case scenario here is that once we combine the data with R that our computers won’t be able to function at all.
* Our plan B for this scenario is that we find a computer, possibly ATC, or from a mentor that could handle the data.
* If not, we would have to make smaller queries for our computer to be able to handle. We can focus more on specific data and analyze smaller groups of data.
* Since the data is so large, we may not be able to dive into the data as in depth as we have with much smaller data sets. This could potentially lead us to misrepresenting the dataset and providing a deliverable to Ms. Coyne that is both inaccurate and potentially dangerous. 
* For this scenario, if we see that we are running out of time and have too much data to go through. We would pick specific factors we want to focus on, based on our partner and just focus on that. Quality over quantity!

### Our client is incredibly busy!

* Despite efforts to reach out to our client we have not been able to meet with them yet. We’ve been told that they will be busy for the rest of the month, and we’re still not sure if she’ll be free for us the next. In addition to this, we’ve been given a handful of different benchmarks for what success looks like. Our biggest concern here is that we will provide a deliverable that is not useful or not similar to what the client had in mind. 
* For this scenario, we would just have to keep bugging her until she nudges, and when we finally do meet her to have an extensive list of questions to make that time worth a while.
* We would also try to get Datalab directors to talk to her, she is a client and needs to be able to set some time to speak to us. 
* In the case that she never replies, we do know that Jim Peterman has been in contact with her, so we can try to reach her through him or just have him fill her role if she’s that busy.

### Uncertainty about the level of accuracy for the predictive model. 
* Although predicting trends is an aspirational goal of ours, as aforementioned, we do not want to make a product that is dangerously inaccurate and misleading. The consequences for misleading our partner and lawmakers could hinder the advocacy work for syringe exchange clinics, which defeats our purpose. 
* If we have a hard time creating an acceptable predictive model, we will consult with Datalab’s technical staff and allow them to help guide our next steps. 
* If we decide not to produce the predictive model, we will let it be a starting point for future Datalab interns or Amber Coyne’s tech staff to pick up and work on
